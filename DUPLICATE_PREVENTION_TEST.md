# Duplicate Data Prevention - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach to verify that duplicate data creation issues have been resolved in the microservices application.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Contract Creation Tests

#### Test 1.1: Single Contract Creation
**Objective**: Verify that creating a contract results in exactly one record
**Steps**:
1. Open contract creation form
2. Fill in all required fields (customer, address, job details)
3. Submit the form once
4. Verify only one contract record is created in database
5. Check that contract ID is unique

#### Test 1.2: Rapid Form Submission Prevention
**Objective**: Verify that rapid clicking doesn't create duplicates
**Steps**:
1. Fill in contract form
2. Rapidly click submit button multiple times
3. Verify only one contract is created
4. Check that loading state prevents multiple submissions

#### Test 1.3: Enter Key Handling
**Objective**: Verify Enter key doesn't trigger duplicate submissions
**Steps**:
1. Fill in contract form
2. Press Enter in address field
3. Press Enter in description field
4. Verify form doesn't submit unexpectedly
5. Only submit via submit button

### 2. Payment Creation Tests

#### Test 2.1: Single Payment Creation
**Objective**: Verify that creating a payment results in exactly one record
**Steps**:
1. Open payment form for a contract
2. Enter payment amount and method
3. Submit the form once
4. Verify only one payment record is created
5. Check payment amount is correctly recorded

#### Test 2.2: Payment Form Validation
**Objective**: Verify payment validation prevents invalid submissions
**Steps**:
1. Try to submit payment with amount = 0
2. Try to submit payment exceeding remaining amount
3. Verify appropriate error messages
4. Verify no payment records are created for invalid submissions

#### Test 2.3: Concurrent Payment Prevention
**Objective**: Verify that concurrent payments don't create duplicates
**Steps**:
1. Open payment form in two browser tabs
2. Submit payment from both tabs simultaneously
3. Verify only one payment is processed
4. Check that second submission fails with appropriate error

### 3. Backend Validation Tests

#### Test 3.1: Transaction Isolation
**Objective**: Verify transaction isolation prevents race conditions
**Steps**:
1. Make multiple concurrent API calls to create contracts
2. Verify each call creates exactly one record
3. Check database consistency
4. Verify no partial records are created

#### Test 3.2: Input Validation
**Objective**: Verify backend validates all inputs properly
**Steps**:
1. Send API request with null payment amount
2. Send API request with negative payment amount
3. Send API request with invalid contract ID
4. Verify appropriate error responses
5. Verify no records are created for invalid inputs

### 4. API Client Tests

#### Test 4.1: No Fallback for POST/PUT/DELETE
**Objective**: Verify fallback mechanism is disabled for write operations
**Steps**:
1. Stop API Gateway temporarily
2. Try to create contract via frontend
3. Verify request fails (no fallback to direct service)
4. Verify no duplicate records are created

#### Test 4.2: Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify proper error handling without retries
**Steps**:
1. Create contract with invalid data
2. Verify error is displayed to user
3. Verify no retry attempts are made
4. Verify no partial records are created

## Expected Results

### Contract Creation
- ✅ Exactly one contract record per submission
- ✅ Proper validation prevents invalid submissions
- ✅ Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- ✅ Enter key handling works correctly
- ✅ Transaction isolation prevents race conditions

### Payment Creation
- ✅ Exactly one payment record per submission
- ✅ Amount validation prevents overpayment
- ✅ Concurrent submissions are handled properly
- ✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
- ✅ No partial payment records are created

### Backend Services
- ✅ @Transactional annotations ensure atomicity
- ✅ Input validation catches all invalid data
- ✅ Transaction isolation prevents conflicts
- ✅ EntityManager.clear() and flush() work correctly
- ✅ Error handling is consistent across services

### Frontend
- ✅ Form submission handlers prevent duplicates
- ✅ Loading states disable submit buttons
- ✅ Enter key handling is implemented correctly
- ✅ No fallback mechanism for write operations
- ✅ Error messages are displayed properly

## Database Verification Queries

### Check for Duplicate Contracts
```sql
SELECT customer_id, starting_date, ending_date, total_amount, COUNT(*) as count
FROM customer_contracts 
WHERE is_deleted = false
GROUP BY customer_id, starting_date, ending_date, total_amount
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Check for Duplicate Payments
```sql
SELECT customer_contract_id, payment_amount, payment_date, COUNT(*) as count
FROM customer_payments 
WHERE is_deleted = false
GROUP BY customer_contract_id, payment_amount, payment_date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Check Transaction Consistency
```sql
-- Verify all contracts have valid job details
SELECT c.id, c.total_amount, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_details jd WHERE jd.contract_id = c.id AND jd.is_deleted = false) as job_count
FROM customer_contracts c 
WHERE c.is_deleted = false;

-- Verify payment amounts don't exceed contract totals
SELECT c.id, c.total_amount, 
       COALESCE(SUM(p.payment_amount), 0) as total_paid
FROM customer_contracts c
LEFT JOIN customer_payments p ON c.id = p.customer_contract_id AND p.is_deleted = false
WHERE c.is_deleted = false
GROUP BY c.id, c.total_amount
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(p.payment_amount), 0) > c.total_amount;
```

## Performance Tests

### Load Testing
1. Create 100 contracts simultaneously
2. Create 100 payments simultaneously
3. Verify all operations complete successfully
4. Check database consistency after load test

### Stress Testing
1. Rapid form submissions (10 submissions per second)
2. Concurrent API calls from multiple clients
3. Network interruption during submissions
4. Verify system handles stress gracefully

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Logs
- Monitor for duplicate save operations
- Check for transaction rollbacks
- Verify error handling logs
- Monitor EntityManager operations

### Database Logs
- Monitor for constraint violations
- Check for deadlocks
- Verify transaction isolation
- Monitor connection pool usage

## Success Criteria

The duplicate prevention implementation is considered successful if:

1. **Zero Duplicate Records**: No duplicate contracts or payments are created under any test scenario
2. **Proper Error Handling**: All invalid inputs are caught and handled gracefully
3. **Transaction Integrity**: All database operations maintain ACID properties
4. **User Experience**: Forms behave predictably with clear feedback
5. **Performance**: System handles concurrent operations without degradation
6. **Monitoring**: All operations are properly logged for debugging

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered during testing:

1. **Immediate**: Disable problematic features
2. **Short-term**: Revert to previous stable version
3. **Long-term**: Implement additional safeguards
4. **Documentation**: Update this test plan with new scenarios
